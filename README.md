# IPEDS-Data

2/25/2019

Here's the data of all more than 7000 postsecondary institutions with the indicators we as a group have discussed and chosen from 2009 to 2017. 

Since the column names are all abbreviations, how about us starting with replacing columns names with the full description? You guys can either refer to the IPEDS Table Excel file, or the table in the agenda document for your reference.

Then figure out what our data means e.g in the sector of institution columns, what do all these numerical values mean? Convert those numerical values into categorical values if necessary

After that, we can go to clean our data properly.
